<h2>Mac and Cheese and Gasoline</h2>
<br><br>
Do you remember the last thing you ate? You probably do. However, do you remember the ingredients in that food? Chances are, you don’t. Many artificial ingredients that are added to foods have potentially negative health effects; several additives thought to have been harmless were later discovered to be toxic.
<br><br>
Now, food bloggers  Lisa Leake and Vani Hari have been pushing for food brand Kraft to remove certain dyes from its macaroni and cheese. These dyes require a warning label to be displayed on products that contain them in Europe, and, in certain countries, they are banned altogether. 
<br><br>
While Kraft has completely removed these dyes from the macaroni and cheese in other countries, it has not done so in America.
<br><br>
The dyes in question, yellow dyes 5 and 6, have been known to be unhealthy. For example, Tartrazine, a chemical used to make yellow dye 5, is derived from petroleum. Petroleum is the same stuff that’s used to make gasoline. 
<br><br>
Tartrazine can cause migraines, anxiety and a myriad of other undesirable conditions and symptoms. Yellow dye 6 also has been linked to several symptoms, such as hyperactivity in children and digestive issues.
<br><br>
If they are so bad for us, why does Kraft insist on using these dyes in their American products, especially if they’ve already gotten rid of them in the European counterparts? This is partially due to the fact that the color of food can actually affect the taste of it. 
<br><br>
For example, Pepsi and Coca Cola both had clear cola products in the 1990s that somewhat resembled the appearance of Sprite but tasted like Cola. Ultimately, however, these products did not succeed because consumers were so used to cola being brown.
<br><br>
Luckily for concerned consumers of Kraft macaroni and cheese, these food bloggers already have submitted a petition with 270,000 signatures to Kraft, and, hopefully, it will only be a matter of time before these dyes are removed from the mac and cheese in America. However, yellow dyes 5 and 6 aren’t the only common food additives that may raise some health concern.
<br><br>
A common food preservative that is included in some dried fruits, called sulfur dioxide, is toxic when in a gaseous form and is emitted by volcanoes. Phosphoric acid, a main ingredient in Coca Cola, is used in cleaners designed to take rust off of metal. Boric acid, which was a common food additive in the late 1800s and early 1900s, was later found to be toxic to humans and has been known to cause kidney failure and possibly death. Boric acid was again introduced into food in World War II, but it was finally banned for food use in the 1950s.
<br><br>
This case with boric acid should come as a warning call; as the cliché goes, if we don’t acknowledge our history, we are doomed to repeat it. Because many of the artificial additives that are used now have not been around for very long, long term studies of the health effects that these additives have on humans have not been conducted. This means that it is possible that the coloring in that mac and cheese you just ate or the preservatives in that meatloaf you ate last night could give you cancer in 50 years.
