<h2>Empathy leads to Justice</h2>
<br><br>
Pakistani author Mohsin Hamed once said, “Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself.” Harper Lee, author of To Kill A Mockingbird, would likely agree with this statement and take it a step further -- true justice and equality is only achieved through finding these echoes of yourself in others. In her novel to Kill a Mockingbird, a terrible injustice is committed and it becomes one character's, Atticus’, quest throughout the novel to right the wrong. However, through Atticus’ quest, and ultimate failure, to find justice, it becomes apparent that Lee argues for more empathy in society to prevent further injustices; Lee urges her readers to put themselves in another’s shoes before making judgements about them.

When Lee pitts society against Atticus, but still chooses to have Atticus serve as the novel’s role model and moral compass, she forces her readers to see a different perspective - Scout’s and by extension, Atticus’. Lee forces us into a minority perspective so that we can understand that we must sometimes shift from the majority view to the minority in order to see true justice. Atticus’ quest for justice seems noble and just from our perspective, but to the townspeople it seems wrong. His sense of justice is clearly reliant on empathy and compassion, which echoes Lee’s message; he tells Scout and Jem “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view… until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.” He repeats this sentiment to Scout and Jem often, which affects their perspective throughout the entire novel, and by extension, the reader; we are given a more unbiased perspective of justice than we would not have received had the novel been told from the perspective of a racist townsperson, or Mayella Ewell. This perspective of justice, a compassionate understanding of both sides and an insatiable quest for fact and truth, goes hand in hand with the message Lee conveys to the reader -- that empathy and compassion trumps judgement.

Although Atticus’ initial legal quest for justice fails, and the injustice of Tom’s death still occurs, justice is served in another form when Bob Ewell is killed by Boo Radley. Boo Radley was not framed as innocent or moral, but rather frightening and mysterious, yet he ultimately completed the quest for justice in the novel. Once again, this is evidence of Lee’s plea to the reader to see things from another perspective - Scout, and other characters as well, made judgements about Boo that turned out to be completely incorrect. But when Scout begins to “climb into (Boo’s) skin and walk around in it,” these judgements begin to fade and she begins to see Boo for the kind person he is -- he gives the children gifts, and wraps blankets around Scout after the fire. Lee chooses Boo as the unlikely hero that fulfills the novel-long quest for justice, to further demonstrate that the people we judge the most are often the most apt at determining right from wrong.

Lee believes that empathy is necessary in society to remove injustices and inequality, and this opinion becomes clear in the way that Lee portrays not only Atticus’ attempt to find justice throughout the novel, but how he perceives justice itself as well. In a society where injustices occur seemingly more and more frequently, Lee’s message is more relevant and applicable than ever; if we can find it in ourselves to give compassion to others, the world around us might become a better place.
