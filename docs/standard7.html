During my freshman year, we were required to write a research essay on a topic of our choice. I chose to research how much physical paper we use at schools and the impact that paper usage has on the environment, as well as alternatives to paper and their costs. That essay can be found <a ng-click="popUp('paper')">here</a>. Although it is fairly convincing with the use of so many statistics, its structure is simplistic and its transitions choppy. A single guiding idea is present, but simplistic. <div class="divider">---</div>
This year, I also wrote a research <a ng-click="popUp('theroad')">essay</a>; this one, however, was much longer than my freshman essay and better demonstrated my ability to research a topic over an extended period of time and synthesize the ideas I collect from that research into a cohesive essay. At over 6 pages long, it was difficult to organize so much information; yet, I did so in a smoother fashion than I did with a 3 page essay as a freshman. I believe this really speaks to how much my writing, and my ability to synthesize a vast amount of information, has improved over my four years at Vista.
