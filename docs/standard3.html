During my freshman year we were required to write a narrative about a significant event in our lives, in the first person. I chose to write about when I broke my front teeth in middle school (although I fudged quite a few details) in a narrative called <a href="" ng-click="popUp('broken')">'Broken'</a>.<div class="divider">---</div>

Most every aspect of my writing -- tone, diction, the rhythm of the story -- has vastly improved since then. I feel this is best exemplified with an <a href="" ng-click="popUp('adventure')">excerpt</a> from the beginning of a story that I started writing this year. My language is more descriptive and more mature, but not fluffy or superfluous. <div class="divider">---</div>

My freshman year narrative is stuffed with melodramatic verbs that don't quite fit, and the tempo of the story doesn't change much. This is in stark contrast to the well chosen verbs of the second story, with a rhythm that adapts to the story to create a clearer picture. Repetitive "Thump"s slow down the tempo, letting the reader envision the tranquility of the environment that he's traversing. The speed of the story seems to pick up as he accelerates.
