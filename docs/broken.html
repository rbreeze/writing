<h2>Broken</h2>
In an instant, I saw the ground rush up at my face. As I hit the ground, I felt my jaw rattle and I heard a loud crack echo through my head. I'd cracked my front teeth. This innocent overnight excursion at school led to an eventful day of broken teeth and lots of dental work, but something positive did come out of the experience- I've learned to think before I act. 
<br><br>
In the summer after 6th grade, our school had an overnight "lock in" in the gym and multipurpose room. As I walked through the entrance, I felt the warmth of indoors quickly shake off the slight chill of late evening. After we had stuffed ourselves with a buffet of junk food and sugar, we went into the gym and played games with the lights off. The sounds of screams echoed off the walls of the spacious, stuffy room. Rumors of ghosts had begun to circulate- some friends and I had decided to take advantage of the dark and spook people. Most people would think that it was here, in the confines of a pitch black gym, that I got hurt. Funnily enough, this is not the case. 
<br><br>
Eventually we were told to turn the lights back on and do something else. In the lobby in front of the multipurpose room, towering blue tumbling mats had been rolled up and put aside for the summer. Somebody thought it would be smart to take down the rolled up mats and push them across the floor while one person lay in the center. For the person inside, it was a thrill ride, but for the few people pushing the mat across the floor, it was a workout. When my turn came to push the mat, I braced my feet on the ground and put the weight of my small body against the mat. Combined with the efforts of the other people pushing, the mat began to roll. It gained more and more momentum as it rolled across the large lenoleum floors, and on each turn it got harder to keep up. On one push, I didn't let go in time. I felt myself roll with the mat, and in an instant I saw the cold, hard, unforgiving ground rush up at my weak and vulnerable face. As I hit the ground, face first, I felt my jaw rattle and I heard a deafening crack ring out in my head. As I got up, I had no feeling in my mouth, but noticed small, white fragments of something littering the floor. I quickly put two and two together and came to a terrible conclusion- I'd cracked my front teeth.
<br><br>
I rushed to the bathroom to examine what had happened to my teeth. In the mirror I could see blood seeping through the cracks of one tooth, exaggerating the broken fragments of the tooth. The other tooth was clean- it had snapped right in half. I tried to wash off the blood, but I winced in pain as I felt the water channel through the cracks of my tooth and reach my exposed nerve ending. I walked out of the bathroom to go get a teacher, my mind in shock of the events that had just unfolded in front of my eyes. After talking to a teacher, I made the terrible decision not to call my parents- I didn't want to bother them with my problems at four in the morning. However, this is a decision that I still regret today. 
<br><br>
For the rest of the night, I wandered around the gym talking to friends, anxiously waiting for the sun to rise and my parents to arrive. Just after dawn, I saw my mom's SUV pull into the parking lot and I braced myself as she walked in the door. I had thought for hours about how to break the news, but in the end I flashed my teeth at her and simply stated "Mom, I cracked my teeth." A thousand emotions flashed across her face at once- I will never forget the guilt I felt for her. We got in the car and first called my dad, and then immediately afterward, called the dentist. We got an appointment for a few hours later, so first I went home and took a nap. The rest of the day was a blur as I went from doctor to doctor, getting fragments of teeth pulled out, needle after needle stabbing my gums, X-rays and more X-rays, and at one point, a root canal. For weeks afterward, I kept recieving dental work, and I even started my 7th grade year without one of my front teeth.

As a more mature person looking back on this experience now, I've learned to think before I act. Rash decisions can lead to painful consequences that can last for years, or even decades, afterward.
