Over the past 4 years as my writing has grown stronger, so have my opinions. The latter might actually be one of the causes of the former, as I find it much easier to argue or write about something that I genuinely care about. I've changed a lot as a person too -- my confidence grew, and I've become more sure of who I am. Although I believe this is just a natural process that everyone goes through (and thus writing didn't have much bearing on who I've become), I believe that writing has been an outlet to articluate my thoughts and polish the ideas that formulate in my head. Without the writing experiences I've had at Vista, the ideas in my head would stay there forever and never reach the outside world; or at least, they would reach the outside world in an inarticulate conglomeration of ineffective words. The things I've learning in my English classes have prepared me to go into the outside world (or the collegiate world) and not just absorb the ideas of others, but produce my own as well. English has taught me to always question the things I'm told, to always dig deeper, and to never EVER use hyperboles.
