One example of my ability to make a reasonable claim and support it is in a newspaper article that I wrote, which synthesizes three stories and makes a connection between them all to prove a point. Click <a ng-click="popUp('nike')">here</a> to view it. <div class="divider">---</div>
In this article, I discuss the near monopoly that a large sports corporation, Nike, has over an entire industry. I discuss three instances that prove my point -- doping allegations, unapologetic corporate control of a national institution, and an executive level death threat -- and bring in a plethora of outside evidence to support each one. This topic is relevant to anyone who enjoys sports in the United States and is thus "substantive" one.
