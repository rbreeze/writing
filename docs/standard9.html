Every year since I entered high school, I've had to write essays that analyze literature, and all of them use direct evidence from the book being analyzed. During my freshman year, we were repeatedly told to introduce quotes with "speaker and context"; this is a skill that I still haven't mastered to the day, but I've implemented it well enough in my essays throughout the years and my ability to quote literature has improved a lot since I first learned it.<div class="divider">---</div>
One of my first high school essays was on Ray Bradbury's <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, which I claimed "warns us about the dangers of becoming addicted to technology, and tells us to take a new perspective on it before we arrive at a society like the one described in this book." Although this thesis is not as nuanced or complex as it could be, it answers the prompt (essentially it asked what was the theme of the novel) and gets the job done. I support the thesis with evidence from the novel by saying "Bradbury describes the happiness Montag gets from his job- 'Montag grinned the fierce grin of all men singed and driven back by flame... It never went away, that smile, it never ever went away, as long as he remembered.'" Although the quote's introduction is simple, it is far better than stating the quote outright. However, the quote is somewhat irrelevant to the thesis. <div class="divider">---</div>
Fast forward to this year, and I am much better at picking relevant quotes to support my overarching claim. In a revision of an in class <a ng-click="popUp('transition')">essay</a>, where we were asked to analyze the characterization of a character named Caroline in a prose passage. My thesis stated: 
<br><br> "Bronte (the author) depicts Caroline at an optimistic transition period between childhood, which Bronte characterizes as a magical 'Elf Land,' and adulthood, where the magic fades and reality sets in." <br><br>
I support this claim with single-word quotes and analysis of those words -- "Words like 'Half-divine', 'marvellous fiction,' 'unreal,' and 'heroic' all have positive connotations and are often associated with childhood fantasies and memories; these words make us look fondly back at our own childhoods, but at the same time, they make us realize our own naivety in the past. By using these words and invoking these emotions, Bronte places Carolineâ€™s life in context..." <br><br>
This analysis guides the reader through my train of thought and effectively supports my original claim; in comparison to my freshman year, this evidence and analysis is much more skillful.
