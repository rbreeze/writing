For a 2 month long research essay exploring the literary merit of Cormac McCarthy's <i>The Road</i>, we were required to revise our essays many times. The following quotes show a topic sentence for a paragraph in the essay; the first is the very first appearance of the statement (in my essay outline), while the second is directly from the final draft. <div class="divider">---</div>

"<i>The Road</i> is thought provoking and requires its readers to think about the human experience and what value love adds to it."<div class="divider">---</div>

"Furthermore, McCarthy’s minimalistic style in crafting <i>The Road</i> allows readers to envision themselves in McCarthy’s bleak landscape, and this sympathy leads readers to ponder the human experience and consider the value love adds to it."<div class="divider">---</div>

While the first provides a clear and direct statement, the second takes what the first did well and adds to it. A transition better connects it to the previous paragraph, while an extra clause offers causation for the claim, thus making it more convincing. This is just one example of my writing being "strengthened"; more examples can be found in the differences between my in class essays and their revised drafts. <div class="divider">---</div>

One such in class essay is an open question about justice; my first draft was written in class while the <a ng-click="popUp('justice')">final draft</a> was revised for about a week. The most apparent change between the two can be seen in the introductions, which are shown below. <div class="divider">---</div>

"Pakistani author Mohsin Hamed once said, “Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself.” Harper Lee, author of <i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i>, would likely agree with this statement and take it a step further -- true justice and equality is only achieved through empathy and compassion. In her novel <i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i>, a terrible injustice is committed and it becomes one character's, Atticus’, quest throughout the novel to right the wrong. However, when Atticus’ quest for justice fails, it becomes apparent that Lee argues for more empathy in society to prevent further injustice; Lee urges her readers to put themselves in another’s shoes before making judgements about them." <div class="divider">---</div>

Although the differences between these two paragraphs are subtle, I replaced several phrases with new ones (for example, "true justice and equality is only achieved through empathy and compassion" becomes "true justice and equality is only achieved through finding these echoes of yourself in others") that are more clear and allow the paragraph to flow better. Throughout many years of writing essays, I feel I've gradually improved at the process of revision and have now achieved near-mastery.
