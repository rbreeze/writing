For a 2 month long research essay exploring the literary merit of Cormac McCarthy's <i>The Road</i>, we were required to revise our essays many times. The following quotes show a topic sentence for a paragraph in the essay; the first is the very first appearance of the statement (in my essay outline), while the second is directly from the final draft. <div class="divider">---</div>

"The Road is thought provoking and requires its readers to think about the human experience and what value love adds to it."<div class="divider">---</div>

"Furthermore, McCarthy’s minimalistic style in crafting The Road allows readers to envision themselves in McCarthy’s bleak landscape, and this sympathy leads readers to ponder the human experience and consider the value love adds to it."<div class="divider">---</div>

While the first provides a clear and direct statement, the second takes what the first did well and adds to it. A transition better connects it to the previous paragraph, while an extra clause offers causation for the claim, thus making it more convincing. This is just one example of my writing being "strengthened"; more examples can be found in the differences between my in class essays and their revised drafts.
