<h2>Transition</h2>
<br><br>
As a young child, visiting amusement parks seems to be a truly magical experience. At even earlier ages, just a small playground seems like an entire world open to exploration. But going back to these places after we’ve grown up reveals the flaws in them, and takes away much of the magic-- amusement parks are too expensive and too fake, and the playground is too boring and too small. In a passage from her novel Shirley, Charlotte Bronte describes a similar phenomenon in her character Caroline, as she nears the age of 18. Bronte depicts Caroline at an optimistic transition period between childhood, which Bronte characterizes as a magical “Elf Land,” and adulthood, where the magic fades and reality sets in.

Bronte wants her readers to remember their own dreamlike childhoods in a positive way, and she elicits this nostalgia with vivid imagery. Words like “Half-divine”, “marvellous fiction,” “unreal,” and “heroic” all have positive connotations and are often associated with childhood fantasies and memories; these words make us look fondly back at our own childhoods, but at the same time, they make us realize our own naivety in the past. By using these words and invoking these emotions, Bronte places Caroline’s life in context -- Caroline is just exiting this phase and entering into the next. As Bronte put it, “Elf-land lies behind us, the shores of Reality rise in front.” This language describes the transition period that Caroline is in, and lets the reader understand Caroline’s perspective -- she looks optimistically at her own Reality, and eagerly, albeit naively, welcomes it.

But Bronte also injects some of her own adult wisdom into the passage as well, which shows the reader what Bronte believes lies ahead for Caroline; Bronte knows that Caroline faces trials and tribulations in her future that she doesn’t yet know about. She personifies these as “Experience” and characterizes her as “humbling, crushing, grinding but yet purifying, and invigorating.” This diction transitions from words with a negative, unpleasant connotation to words with positive connotations that conjure images of cleansing and rebirth. This transition is similar to the one between young adulthood and mature adulthood that Bronte is describing in the passage. Most readers have been through experiences that could be described by these words, and therefore this phrase makes the reader more sympathetic to Caroline and show the reader where Caroline currently stands in the journey of her life. A shift in diction can also be seen throughout the entire passage from bright, hopeful language like “delightful” to foreboding word choices such as “poison”. This shift exemplifies part of the shift in life that Bronte is describing in her passage -- from a magical childhood to a difficult young adulthood. Bronte also shows the reader that Caroline has “Hope”, and “Love”, but Bronte shows us that although Love may seem innocent to the 18 year old Caroline, she characterizes Love as a warrior whose “quiver is not seen… there are no fears of poison,” which reveals how Bronte views young love, and love in general -- she characterizes it as sly and unsuspecting, and easy to trust, but reveals its dangers as well to show Caroline’s naivete. Bronte uses Love as yet another example of childhood magic fading away and revealing hidden danger.

Although the facades and illusions around us fade as we grow older, Bronte characterizes this transition not as an altogether bad thing, but rather describes it as a sort of baptism that washes away our innocence to make room for better things on the horizon. Even though the playground may seem smaller than we once remembered it, our worlds have become larger and our horizons have been broadened; it is this concept that Bronte embodies in her passage.
