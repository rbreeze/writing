<h2>The Science of The Martan</h2>
While suffering through the myriad of trailers before my movie, each new trailer seemed longer and duller than the last. Neck deep in this sea of uninteresting commercials, one island of hope stood out along the horizon. This trailer captured my attention in five seconds flat, and had me on the edge of my seat for every remaining second of the preview. It gave me chills. In fact, I liked these three minutes of content better than the entirety of the movie I went to see.  
<br><br>
This was the trailer for Ridley Scott’s The Martian. The movie involves a NASA astronaut, Mark Watney, who becomes stranded on Mars after his team believes him to be dead and evacuates the planet. He has no contact with NASA, and the soonest another mission can reach him is four years, but his supplies were designed to last 30 days. The movie follows his scientific struggle to survive and contact NASA.

The enormous geek that I am, this piqued my interest enough to compel me to go home and do more research about the movie. Within a few minutes I discovered that the movie was, as is the case with many new movies these days, based on a book of the same title. Within a few more minutes I had downloaded the book and began reading.
<br><br>
I was hooked. The meticulous research behind every statistic, every calculation, that author Andy Weir included, was obvious. It made me feel as if I was on Mars right next to the main character. It made me wonder… how accurate was the book, and by extension, the movie? Are the events depicted even plausible?  
<br><br>
Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who was the first Canadian to walk in space and is known for uploading videos of common tasks and experiments being performed in space, seems to think so. “It has the very rare combination of a good, original story, interestingly real characters and fascinating technical accuracy…reads like ‘MacGyver’ meets ‘Mysterious Island,” said Hadfield.  
<br><br>
NASA, which plays a huge role in both the movie and the book, also commends the book for its accuracy. When producing the film, director Ridley Scott and other film crew visited and consulted frequently with NASA’s real-life Jet Propulsion Laboratory. However, both the movie and the book have plots based entirely on things going dramatically wrong. Real-life astronaut Drew Feutsel points this out, saying, “I watched this movie, I read this book, and it’s just amazing – I was really captivated. But as an astronaut, the last thing you want to have happen is something to go wrong, someone to be left behind, someone to be dead. That is not part of our business.”  
<br><br>
However, Feutsel also highlights the ability of the movie to interest the public in space. “The challenge we have at NASA – even as astronauts – part of our role is to go out and educate the public, talk to kids and inspire people. But unfortunately we do that with boring things that we do really well,” he says. 
<br><br> 
One technical difficulty that the movie and book do not address is funding. In America today, NASA would lack the funding necessary to send men to Mars. But with movies like The Martian, more funding might be given to ventures such as going to Mars.  Given the extensive research that both Weir and Scott put into their respective works, including the aforementioned consultations with NASA employees, as well as the endorsements from NASA astronauts and other scientific authorities, it is safe to conclude that not only is The Martian as accurate as it can feasibly be, it also opens up the field of space exploration and astronomy to a broader audience. 

<h3>Richmond’s Mission to Mars</h3>
The story also raises the question, when will we actually land a man, or woman, on Mars? If our government won’t fund it now, when will they?  NASA hopes to land a manned mission to Mars during the 2030s, according to their Journey to Mars page. However, before this, in the 2020s, they hope to send a manned Orion mission to an asteroid beyond Low-Earth Orbit, then return with a piece of the asteroid and place it in orbit around the moon.  Besides NASA, other private entities have goals to land humans on Mars as well. One such example is an organization called Mars One, whose website is linked below:

<br><br>
Although they have not specified exactly how soon they hope to send a mission to Mars, Mars One has begun selecting candidates for the mission crew, and has now narrowed down the list of hundreds of applicants to just 100 finalists. One such finalist has a local connection — Vista math teacher Mr. Richmond’s wife, Kristin Richmond, has been placed in the top 100 candidates for Mars One’s mission. 
<br><br> 
Not only does Mars One hope to land humans on Mars, they hope to establish a permanent colony there. This, Mars One says on their “Mission Feasibility” page, makes landing humans on Mars much easier as resources won’t need to be spent on a return trip.  Mars One will send missions to Mars in phases, with 4 astronauts going at a time. After one more round of selections, Mars One will have its final group of people who will make the trip to Mars and establish a colony. They will then begin training, which consists of group tasks as well as technical skills training, according to Mars One’s “Astronauts” page, which is linked below:

<br><br>
Other private entities that are assisting in the quest to send humans to Mars include Space X, which has a contract with NASA to develop rockets that could someday send men to Mars, and Boeing, which hopes to send astronauts on its “Affordable Mars Mission Design”. These enterprises may be joined by new entities, inspired by The Martian or other new Mars-related media. More titles like The Martian — science fact more than science fiction books — could spur a new generation of scientists and engineers, all focused on taking humanity to Mars and beyond.
