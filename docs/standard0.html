My name is Remington Breeze. <br> <div class="divider">---</div>

This year I've had a lot of free time since I'm a senior, so I've had lots of time to dedicate myself to my favorite things -- running (or just being working out in general), writing software, and listening to music. This year was my best Cross Country season yet ( I placed 10th in the State meet) and I also published my first iPhone app. I even had time to program this website from scratch! It's amazing what I can do when I only have one academically challenging class. <br> <div class="divider">---</div>

I like pizza and I love pie (but alas I can't eat very much of it); I've got two younger siblings (a sister and a brother) and an awesome pit-bull puppy named Cashmere (okay fine she's not a puppy, she's almost 8 but she still thinks she's a puppy). <br> <div class="divider">---</div>

I really enjoy writing and I've wanted to write a novel since I was in elementary school. I've never quite finished one (or even come close), but I've got a few ideas that I've worked on and maybe someday I'll finish one. When I write for school or formal essays I usually use more sophistocated language than when I write creatively.
