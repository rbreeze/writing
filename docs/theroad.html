<h2>The Road as Classic Literature</h2>
<br><br>
Aristotle, famous Greek philosopher, once said, “The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance.” Many novels fall short of this definition of art, employing cheap tricks like dramatic romances, suspenseful action sequences and the like to reach as broad an audience as possible. However, a select few rise above the rest and give readers a genuine peek into an author’s mind, and heart. Cormac McCarthy’s novel The Road is one such work of art— rather than make use of flowery or superfluous language for the sake of painting a pretty or interesting picture, McCarthy’s style is simple yet powerful and conveys his deepest emotions. Because it is a carefully and uniquely crafted window into McCarthy’s soul, and by extension a work of art, The Road earns its spot amongst the classics in the literary canon; in the process of crafting his novel, McCarthy also addresses several topics relating to the human condition, most notably love, and in doing so provokes thought in the reader and further establishes his work as a classic.

McCarthy is very clearly an artist, and his art form is his writing; this passion shines through in his work in his syntax and the vivid post-apocalyptic landscape that he creates. In a recent interview with Oprah Winfrey, Winfrey asks McCarthy about how his writing begins and the processes he uses to create his novels. McCarthy replies: “You have this interior image of something that is absolutely perfect, and that’s your signpost and your guide. You’ll never get there, but without it you’ll never get anywhere.” McCarthy wrote the novel from a place of love and tried to convey his emotions through the novel, and it is from this place of raw human emotion that classics are born. Rather than think of his writing as a chore, McCarthy views it as his art form and works daily towards his goal of turning his feelings into words. When asked if he writes on a schedule in the same Oprah Winfrey interview, McCarthy responded that he does and mentions a quote from William Faulkner: “I only write when inspiration strikes. Fortunately it strikes at nine every morning.” Although McCarthy’s writing schedule is structured, he doesn’t view the task as laborious or taxing; instead he brings unbridled enthusiasm to his desk every day that inspires him to “do something today better than I’ve ever done before” (Winfrey). The works of art that withstand the test of time and that are considered to have intrinsic value are the ones whose creators truly care about expressing themselves through their work; McCarthy’s novel is a testament to this pattern.

Furthermore, McCarthy’s minimalistic style in crafting The Road allows readers to envision themselves in McCarthy’s bleak landscape, and this sympathy leads readers to ponder the human experience and consider the value love adds to it. McCarthy’s choice to exclude names for all characters further allows a reader to imagine themselves in the situation he depicts -- everyone is someone’s son or daughter, and many readers are someone’s father or mother. McCarthy’s minimalistic telling of his story forces readers to subconsciously put themselves in the shoes of the Boy or the Man, and by extension encourages them to contemplate what value their family brings to their lives. One scene in particular demonstrates this melancholic style that allows a reader to envision themselves as one of the characters -- when the Man cuts the Boy’s hair. McCarthy writes, “When he was done he took the towel from around the boy’s shoulders and he scooped the golden hair from the floor and wiped the boy’s face and shoulders with a damp cloth and held a mirror for him to see.” (McCarthy 230). McCarthy’s repetition of the word “boy” almost forces a reader to envision the “boy” in their own lives -- whether that be a son, a younger brother, or a cousin -- and allows the reader to sympathize with what the Man is feeling. In conjunction with the mundane nature of the scene (nearly everyone has had a haircut), this subconscious authorial nudge to contemplate human life helps qualify McCarthy’s novel as a classic. 
Not only is The Road stylistically unique and thoughtful, it doesn’t follow the conventions of previous post-apocalyptic or dystopian texts; instead, its simplicity sets a precedent for future novels and establishes a new medium for storytelling. Whereas many post-apocalyptic and dystopian novels dream of future technologies and corrupt dictatorships that exploit these technologies for their own gain, The Road instead focuses on the desolation of a post-apocalyptic world with no government and no technology. While it is difficult for readers to imagine themselves using a piece of technology that hasn’t yet been invented in a world that we haven’t yet seen, it is quite easy for readers to see themselves walking down McCarthy’s road with someone who they care deeply about right beside them. With The Road, McCarthy has set the stage for other novels that have yet to be written that follow a similar framework; he doesn’t just meet the bar, he raises it and it is this supplantation of the standard that nominates The Road as a classic.

McCarthy is not only an original artist, but an opinionated one as well -- McCarthy doesn’t intentionally inject his opinions into the novel nor does explicitly state them, but he has very clear stances on the topics that he addresses, which bleed through in the novel and add to its value. At the very beginning of the novel, McCarthy describes the man watching the boy sleep with gentle language: “He’d reach out to touch the child sleeping beside him… His hand rose and fell softly with each precious breath” (McCarthy 1). Words like “softly” and “precious” have very innocent and childlike associations, which contrasts with the clinical tone that McCarthy uses throughout the rest of the novel. This is evidence of McCarthy’s feelings about his son, and evidence that his emotions present themselves subconsciously in his writing. In the interview mentioned above, with Oprah Winfrey, McCarthy is asked about the inspiration for The Road. He responds that he was inspired by looking at his son as he slept in a hotel room; he then looked out the hotel window and could envision the landscape as a desolate wasteland, so he wrote several paragraphs of The Road that night. McCarthy goes on to say that in writing The Road, he wanted to capture the emotions he felt for his son that night. In capturing these emotions, McCarthy’s opinion on love is made evident -- love adds value to human life even in the bleakest situations.
McCarthy didn’t intend to do anything more than tell a story and capture the emotions he felt toward his son, but the simplicity and creativity of the novel allows for readers to interpret it in many different ways. For example, scholar Lydia Cooper of the University of North Texas discusses the idea that The Road is a retelling of the Book of Revelations in the Bible, and also draws parallels between it and other mythological stories; although McCarthy didn’t purposefully do this and was merely trying to tell a story (Winfrey), his carefully crafted novel tells a message so relevant to humanity that it could be compared to mythological stories that were created thousands of years before its time. Other interpretations of the novel are also of a religious nature, but one mentions the ambiguity of McCarthy’s mentioning of a higher power. According to Professor Erik Wielenberg, the first spoken quote in the novel (“If he is not the word of God God never spoke” [McCarthy 7]) is a two sided coin: “the man’s declaration is that either his son is the word of God, or, for all practical purposes, the universe is a godless one.” This ambiguity reveals another interpretation of the novel -- that McCarthy is demonstrating the unknown presence of an omniscient God. These multiple interpretations are an intrinsic quality of a classic novel; books that are black and white are nothing more than editorials, while novels with grey area are the ones that withstand the test of time.

Every topic that McCarthy addresses in the novel is relevant not only at the time it was written, but at any other time period as well, because the issues he addresses are directly related to the human experience. Although McCarthy’s most evident theme is about the value of love, his novel also addresses the ideas of hope and a higher power. The existence of a higher power in the novel is ambiguous, and therefore speaks to McCarthy’s belief that the very existence of a higher power is ambiguous as well (Wielenberg 1). Professor Shelly Rambo discusses the ideas of hope and redemption in the novel as well, and argues that although the tone of the novel is hopeless, McCarthy’s underlying message is an optimistic one. These issues are ones that will not soon go away, and if they do our humanity will come into question. Hope, love, redemption -- these are all issues that make us question what value our lives have, and what it means to be human.

In artfully pouring his soul into The Road after inspiration struck, McCarthy addresses several thought provoking topics, most notably love. American social reformer Henry Ward Beecher once said, “Every artist dips his brush in his own soul, and paints his own nature into his pictures." In McCarthy’s case, his simple style eliminates extraneous elements and allows the reader to experience McCarthy’s emotions with just one layer between the author and his audience -- we feel McCarthy’s affection for his son with every sentence. Every topic that McCarthy addresses is relevant to the human experience in the past and forever onward.

Although McCarthy didn’t set out to create a comment on society, his opinions shine through the pages of the novel and create ambiguity for the reader that allows it to be interpreted in many ways. McCarthy’s most evident opinion is similar to that of German psychologist and psychoanalyst Erich Fromm -- “Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence.” The evident passion and creativity firmly establishes this work as a classic and makes it not only an interesting read in today’s decreasingly literature-focused culture, but also a captivating lesson for readers looking to find meaning in their own lives — McCarthy shows us through the novel that even in a desolate wasteland, love gives us hope and adds value to human existence.
