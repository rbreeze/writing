During my freshman year, I wrote many informative pieces for my Newspaper class, and this year I took the same Newspaper class and have written another informative piece. The first one details the dangers of certain chemicals in Kraft Mac and Cheese, while the second discusses the science behind the recently released movie, <i>The Martian</i>, which was based on Andy Weir's novel of the same name. The first can be found <a href="" ng-click="popUp('macandcheese')">here</a> and the second <a href="" ng-click="popUp('martian')">here</a>. <div class="divider">---</div>
The first, although informative, uses no direct quotes from outside sources and instead relies entirely on paraphrasing, while the second, more recent, article quotes an authority on the subject that I address and also brings in several links relevant to the topic. The writing style in the second is also more professional and sophistocated -- the first is almost patronizing in it's tone and the reader feels talked down to. <div class="divider">---</div>
The Mac and Cheese article, although fairly unbiased, does not "convey complex ideas and information" nearly as well as the second article. The second uses more outside sources to synthesize much more information into a cohesive, informative article.
