Throughout high school I've increasingly used more and more technology to work on, revise, and collaborate on writing. During my Freshman year I used Google Drive for myself, but no teachers required it. My Sophomore year, we were required to post responses to topics on a class blog. During my Junior year, we were required to make our own blogs as well as collaborate with peers on Google Docs. My blog from last year can be found <a href="http://remingtonbreeze.edublogs.org" target="_blank">here</a>.<div class="divider">---</div>
This year I digitally collaborated on many different essays with my peers, recieving and giving comments on Google Docs and even doing a group essay.
