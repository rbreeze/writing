Throughout high school I've increasingly used more and more technology to work on, revise, and collaborate on writing. During my Freshman year I used Google Drive for myself, but no teachers required it. My Sophomore year, we were required to post responses to topics on a class blog. During my Junior year, we were required to make our own blogs as well as collaborate with peers on Google Docs. My blog from last year can be found <a href="http://remingtonbreeze.edublogs.org" target="_blank">here</a>.<div class="divider">---</div>
This year I digitally collaborated on many different essays with my peers, recieving and giving comments on Google Docs and even doing a group essay. I received (and gave) the most digital feedback for this year's Classic Literature <a ng-click="popUp('theroad')">Research Essay</a>; some comments that I received are below: <br><br>

<b>Daniel Baquero</b> (commenting on my conclusion):<br>
"I wouldn't end with a quote, it doesn't feel succinct <br>
Also this is a conclusion yeah?<br>
it almost feels like you're introducing a new topic"

<br><br>

<b>Ryan von Chance</b> (commenting on a transition between a quote and analysis):<br>
"that was a very fast transition from this idea you presented to the ideas of this essay"

<br><br>

<b>Michael Viksne</b> (commenting on a statement in one of my body paragraphs):<br>
"Seems like this would go with your 2nd body"

<br><br>

All of the above comments, as well as many additonal ones, helped me revise my original draft of my essay to make a much, much better final draft. I also left comments on my peers' essays as well, while are below: 

<br><br>

<b>Remington Breeze</b> (commenting on a body paragraph in Michael Viksne's essay):<br>
"you mention the 1980s a lot -- was the book written in the '80's?"

<br><br>

<b>Remington Breeze</b> (commenting on a body paragraph in Ryan von Chance's essay):<br>
"maybe add scholarly evidence here too?"

<br><br>

The use of technology has really improved my writing process, as it allows me to see the ideas of my peers (and help them with their essays), as well as receive direct feedback from them on my essays. As time moves on, I find myself using more and more technology when writing formal essays for school.
