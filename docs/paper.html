<h2>The Impact of Paper used in Schools</h2>
<br><br>
When we use paper, not many people think about its impact, because we use it in small
quantities. We rip out a sheet of binder paper from our notebooks and don't think about its long term effect because it is only one sheet. However, in schools across America, billions of dollars are spent on paper, and as a result, thousands of trees are wasted and thousands of pounds of oxygen are lost; there are, however, more environmentally friendly and cost effective alternatives to paper that should be, but haven't been, embraced by schools.

The amount of paper used by schools is excessive and unnecessary. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are currently about 55.5 million students enrolled in school (Profile America). Based on an average of several class supply lists, in a 12 year period, each student will use about 15,250 pages of paper (“High School 12-13 Class Supply Lists”, “Pearl River High School Class Supply Lists”). This amounts to a total of about 838.75 billion pages used by students in the 12 year period. To calculate the cost of all this paper, assume that each sheet of paper is plain white printer paper from Staples and that 500 sheets of paper, or 1 ream, is $7.79 (Staples Multipurpose Paper Reams). This means that for 838.75 billion sheets of paper, you would have to pay over 13 billion dollars. For comparison, the cost of a Google Nexus 7 tablet for every student in America would be a little over 11 billion dollars. Most students are required to buy a significant portion, of the paper that they use, but the school system also buys much of that paper. With the current recession, and with so many budget problems in America’s schools, we need to start moving away from paper and take advantage of the cheaper and less wasteful products available.

The usage of trillions of sheets of paper results in significant environmental damage. According to Discovery’s HowStuffWorks, an average pine tree can produce 80.5 thousand sheets of paper (How Many Sheets of Paper can be Produced from a Single Tree?). That means that 10.4 million trees would be gone in a 12 year period. Ten point four million trees would be enough to cover an area of 11,500 acres- the size of a small town. Timothy J. Fahey, a professor of ecology at Cornell University, attests that the environmental benefits of a 40 acre forest are as follows, “An approximate value for a 50-year-old oak [40 acre] forest would be 30,000 pounds of carbon dioxide sequestered per acre... the forest would be emitting about 22,000 pounds of oxygen.” (Ray) This means that a 12 year old, 11,500 acre forest would absorb more than 2 million pounds of carbon dioxide and produce over 1.5 million pounds of oxygen. Unfortunately, this forest is only hypothetical because the usage of paper by students has prevented it from growing. Louise Story, writer for the New York Times, points out the size and impact of the paper industry, “...the paper industry is not without impact. Because of its consumption of energy, the industry... emits the fourth-highest level of carbon dioxide among manufacturers, according to a 2002 study by the Energy Information Administration, a division of the Department of Energy.” (Story) Not only does the usage of trees themselves make a large impact on the environment, the energy that is required to produce the paper has a large output of carbon dioxide.

Paper can be cumbersome and wasteful, while new technologies can enhance and open new opportunities to learning. In a survey of 126 high school students that used iPads for lessons 3 times a week, students were asked about the ease of use of the iPads and whether they prefer the iPad or a laptop. On a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being easiest to use, students rated the iPad at an average of 4.11. However, 74% of students preferred using a laptop to an iPad (Gliksman). There are several options available to students that are all cheaper than paper; the $329 iPad mini or a $199 Google Nexus 7 tablet would appeal to the 26% of students that preferred iPads to laptops, while a $299 laptop would be the ideal solution for the rest of the student body. Both of these options would result in less waste and cost than paper does currently, and with the modern advancements of technology, these mediums could all open up more opportunity for creativity to students and help the current generation to become even more technologically adept.

Not only does paper have a huge environmental impact in more ways than one, it also has a large impact financially. Despite the fact that there are better options available for students to do their schoolwork, the school system has yet to completely replace paper because of trepidations about the cost and distraction of technology. However, the benefits of technology are numerous and hopefully, in the years to come, more and more schools will begin to embrace it.
