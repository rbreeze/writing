During my Freshman year, I wasn't required to write many essays within a constrained time frame; all but one was out-of-class and took at least a week to write. During my sophomore year, I was introduced to in-class essays in AP World History, but during English most of our in-class writing was single paragraphs or short answer. Last year, however, I wrote many in-class English essays which prepared me for this year's weekly in-class essays. <div class="divider">---</div>
None of my previous English classes, however, prepared me for this year's ~4 week long research essay.
