During my Freshman year, I wasn't required to write many essays within a constrained time frame; all but one was out-of-class and took at least a week to write. During my sophomore year, I was introduced to in-class essays in AP World History, but during English most of our in-class writing was single paragraphs or short answer. Last year, however, I wrote many in-class English essays which prepared me for this year's weekly in-class essays. <div class="divider">---</div>
None of my previous English classes, however, prepared me for this year's ~4 week long research essay, which can be found <a ng-click="popUp('theroad')">here</a>. This was by far the longest formal essay I've ever written for school, and has prepared me for even longer essays that I'll have to write in college.<div class="divider">---</div>
This year's weekly in-class essays have really helped me improve my writing, especially for the AP test. Revising those essays has further helped my writing as it allows me to really think about the prompt for a longer period of time and write a more informed and convincing essay.
